Task
====
Your task is to split the latest commit into 2 smaller commits - one for each
method that was added.


Solution
========
When you are asked to split up previous commit you can start by doing `git reset
--mixed HEAD~1`. That way you will have uncommitted changes in your repository
from this commit. You can then proceed with `git add` or if necessary `git add
-p` followed by `git commit`

Notes
=====
You should never use `git reset` (and some other commands) on changes which have
already been merged in some remote repository. This would cause conflicts for
people you collaborate with and can be confusing. Reworking changes while they
are being reviewed is however necessary and a good thing. Don't be afraid of it!
